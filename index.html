        <h3>Have you ever wondered what day of the week you were born on?</h3>
        I bet most of you have no idea what day of the week you were born on. I guess thats why you're here to find out. <br>
        Ghanians have a beautiful culture where they give their children are given their first name as a 'day name' <br> which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. <br> They names vary with gender, having different names for males and females.
        These are called <em><i>Akan Names.</i></em>
